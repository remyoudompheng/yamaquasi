# Fixed-size arithmetic

Since it is unreasonable to use the quadratic sieve to factor numbers larger
than 512 bits, yamaquasi uses 512-bit arithmetic for exact computations
and 8-bit precision logarithms during the sieving process.

The block size is fixed to consume 512kB of memory per core.

# Linear algebra

Kernel computation for mod 2 matrices is done through a na√Øve Gauss reduction
using bit vectors from crate `bitvec_simd`. It will typically take less than
1 second for a size 5000 matrix.
